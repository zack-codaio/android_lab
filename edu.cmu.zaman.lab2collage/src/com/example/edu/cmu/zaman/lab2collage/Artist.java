/**
 * This interface defines the API for all visual elements which can appear in
 * a collage, including elements intending to primarily provide visual displays
 * as well as those intending to primarily provide layouts for other visual 
 * elements.  (Note that all objects implementing this interface are expected
 * to support and layout child objects.  However, objects primarily providing
 * visual displays are likely to do this in a simple default fashion.)
 * 
 * Each <code>Artist</code> maintains a notion of its position (relative to 
 * its containing or parent <code>Artist</code>) as well as its size.  its
 * size may be determined <i>intrinsically</i> (that is inside the object based
 * on what it draws) or may be set from the outside.  Every <code>Artist</code> 
 * object is responsible for maintaining a possible list of <i>child</i> objects
 * which are contained inside it. Finally, each <code>Artist</code> object is 
 * also responsible for drawing its own appearance, and for arranging for the 
 * layout and drawing of a set of child objects that appear within it.
